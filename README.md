### Mile Atveteli Generator Frontend

## ***Description***

- Frontend part of the Mile Atveteli project
- Backend: https://github.com/claypigeon123/mile-atveteli-backend

This application was developed to work around the manual creation of excel sheets & the manual tracking of their IDs.

This web application generates an excel sheet based on a template. Users now only need to enter details into a form and everything else, including ID generation and tracking, is taken care of behind the scenes.

The web app was deployed internally, so security is lightweight, as specified.


## ***Required Dependencies***

- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/)
- Java 8
